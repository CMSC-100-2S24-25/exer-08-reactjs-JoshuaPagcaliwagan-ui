Joshua O. Pagcaliwagan CMSC 100 C-1L This application is all about a simple e-commerce website with a simple UI, the menus are clickable but it would only refresh the website, and clicking the add to cart button would only give a console.log message. This application utilizes react concepts such as main.jsx, app.jsx, and the component files. It also uses functions, divs, a href, arrays, etc.
